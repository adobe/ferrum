 *
 * # Traits, an introduction: Very specific interfaces that let you choose your guarantees
 *
 * This helps to implement a concept known as type classes in haskell,
 * traits in rust, protocols in elixir, protocols (like the iteration protocol)
 * in javascript.
 * This helper is not supposed to replace ES6 protocols, instead it is supposed
 * to expand on them and make them more powerful.
 *
 * Basically this allows you to declare an interface, similar to interfaces in
 * C++ or C# or Java. You declare the interface; anyone implementing this generic
 * interface (like the iterator protocol, or Size interface which can be used to
 * determine the size of a container) promises to obey the rules and the laws of
 * the interface.
 * This is much more specific than having a size() method for instance; size() is
 * just an name which might be reasonably used in multiple circumstances; e.g. one
 * might use the name size() for a container that can have a `null` size, or return
 * a tuple of two numbers because the size is two dimensional. Or it might require
 * io to return the size or be complex to compute (e.g. in a linked list).
 *
 * A size() method may do a lot of things, the Size trait however has a highly specific
 * definition: It returns the size of a container, as a Number which must be greater than
 * zero and cannot be null. The size must be efficient to compute as well.
 *
 * By using the Size trait, the developer providing an implementation specifically says
 * 'I obey those rules'. There may even be a second trait called `Size` with it's own rules.
 * The trait class is written in a way so those two would not interfere.
 *
 * ## Traits do not provide type checks
 *
 * Because we are in javascript, these guarantees are generally not enforced by the type system
 * and the dev providing an implementation is still responsible for writing extensive tests.
 *
 * # Traits provide abstraction: Think about what you want to do, not how you want to do it
 *
 * One specific feature traits provide is that they let you state what you want to do instead of how
 * to do it.
 * Need to determine the size of a container? Use `.length` for arrays and strings,
 * use `.size` for ES6 Maps and Sets and a for loop to determine the size of an object.
 * Or you could just use the Size trait and call `size(thing)` which works for all of these
 * types. This is one of the features traits provide; define an implementation for a trait
 * once and you no longer have to think about how to achieve a thing, just what to achieve.
 *
 * # Implementing traits for third party types
 *
 * This is another feature that makes traits particularly useful! Java for instance
 * has interfaces, but the creator of a class/type must think of implementing a specific interface;
 * this is particularly problematic if the type is from a library; the interface must
 * either come from the standard library or from that particular library.
 *
 * This usually is not very helpful; with traits this is not a problem at all.
 * Just use `MyTrait.impl` as in the example above.
 *
 * # Subclassing the Trait class
 *
 * You may subclass Trait and overwrite any of it's methods.
 *
 * @class
 * @property {String|undefined} name The name of the trait
 * @property {Symbol} sym The symbol for lookup inside third party classes
